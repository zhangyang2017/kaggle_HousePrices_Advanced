## Problem definition <a id="0"></a>
Train a regression model to predict house pricing using historical data. More details are described [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

## Overview <a id="1"></a>
For this project I decided to use regression models, specifically random forests.

## Workflow <a id="2"></a>
- EDA
  - using pipeline to handle missing values, transform numerical and categorical features, feature engineer, drop unwanted features:

- Model
- Learning curve

## Afterthoughts <a id="3"></a>
The most important thing I learned and applied in this project is using sklearn pipeline.
